###### reading notes class-14b

- it makes a lot of sense to me that productive teams are big on empathy
- I appreciate the acknowledgement that this huge google study shows what good managers have known for all time, lol
- I'm going to take the 'Reading the Mind in the Eyes test' -> it was difficult. I saw keanu reaves in there.
- I wish I could take the team survey that they talk about.
- The best work happens on teams where people feel safe, comfortable, and fully engaged, seems pretty reasonable
- The part about work not being a place where you can be youself really resonates with me. If you do you best work when you're at ease, and at work you are forced to put on a front then of course you're not doing your best work. You're focusing your energy elsewhere!
