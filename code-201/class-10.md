###### class-10 reading notes

I'm not sure why we're learning this one as you don't have to worry about bugs if you've got 1337 h4x...
Today I spent as long as it took me to implement a feature, debugging that same feature.

[What Went Wrong? Troubleshooting JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/What_went_wrong)

1. Name some key differences between a **Syntax Error** and a **Logic Error**.
    - syntax errors are misspellings of variables, improper declarations, missing brackets or semicolons.
    - logic errors are mistakes in code structure, infinite loops, adding your total salmon cookies sold to your *previous* total salmon cookies sold instead of just recalculating it from 0...
1. List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.
    - Unexpected token- I think this is what it says when I either have either not enough or one too many curly braces.
    - Type error- 'can't do x to type Null' I get these when I'm referencing something incorrectly
1. How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?
    - logical error- I havent made any infinite loops in class yet but I have in the past.

[The JavaScript Debugger](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_are_browser_developer_tools#the_javascript_debugger)

1. How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?
    - so the debugger is like console.log on steroids. It can run just a part of your code and put it under a magnifying glass so you can see what happens line by line.
1. Define what a breakpoint is.
    - a breakpoint is a spot set in the debugger to manually pause your codes execution on a specific line.
1. What is the call stack?
    - the call stack is basically just where you've been. what lines of code got you to where you are now.
