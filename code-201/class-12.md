###### class-12 reading notes

We're moving in a new direction. Sort of. Last week we were working with data and tables using Js. This week we're working with data and ??? using Js. My money is on charts.

## Reading

[JavaScript Canvas](https://www.javascripttutorial.net/web-apis/javascript-canvas/)

1. What does the `<canvas>` allow a developer to acheive?
    - 2d drawings made with Js
1. What is the importance of the closing `</canvas> tag?
    - the interior of the canvas tags serves the same purpose as `alt` in an `<img>`
1. Explain what the `getContext()` method does.
    - takes in an argument to determine context(2d is given ex, so maybe there is 3d too?)
    - returns an object that can be used to call draw methods to make lines and boxes, things like that

[Chart.js Documentation](http://www.chartjs.org/docs/):

1. What is Chart.js and how it can be brought into your project?
    - so i'm not certain of the correct term but I would call it a package.
    - its a collection of files that allows you to easily chart graphs using Js canvas
    - you can get it from github or use npm
1. List 3 different Chart types you can create using Chart.js.
    - bubble chart, tres moderne
    - line chart, ultra classic
    - radar chart, video games? github?

[Easily Create Stunning Animated Charts with Chart.js](https://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2013/11/easily-create-stunning-animated-charts-with-chart-js/)

1. What are some advantages to displaying data via a chart over a table?
    - readability, a chart visualizes data in a way normal people can't do by looking at a table
    - this visualization cna help you form new conclusions about your data
1. How could Chart.js aid your previously created applications visually?
    - salmon cookies could definitely use a line chart for every stores hourly sales. though since the numbers are random, you wouldn't really learn anything new from the chart...
