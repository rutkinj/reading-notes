[Learn CSS - Flexbox](https://web.dev/learn/css/flexbox/)

1. Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content. Explain what this means.
    - well one dimension means only x or only y so flexbox is designed to display well either vertically OR horizontally?
    -so it makes good rows or columns
1. Explain the difference between the main axis and cross axis.
    - main axis directly relates to  `flex-direction` which is either row or column.
    - cross axis is inversely related to `flex-direction`.
    - main axis and cross axis are always opposites.

1. How can using certain properties of flexbox negatively impact accessibility?
    - reversing the flow of a flexbox basically makes the page display the opposite of it's html so screenreaders interpret it backwards.

1. What are some advantages of using flexbox over float?

1. How does this topic connect with your long term goals?
