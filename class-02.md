Which loops use a loop counter?

- I think it's just a regular for loop? You can add one to a while loop, but then it just becomes a for loop in a different syntax...

Describe 3 built-in methods for Arrays.

- `equals(arr1, arr2)` used to compare two arrays, returns a bool.
- `binarySearch(arr, value)` performs a binary search for a value and returns the index if found. also the array has to be sorted, so...
- `sort(arr)` sorts item in arr to be ascending. what sorting method does it use?

Use an analogy to explain Built-In packages. Give examples.

- Lets say I bought a build your own computer kit, and it had all the necesary components to put together a powerful gaming rig. Part way through the build I realize I need to email my grandma for a cookie recipe. My computer is mostly put together but I haven't put in my video card or hooked up my very extremely cool and eye-hurting RGB. I can still start my computer and do basic stuff like send an email. But, if I want to anything demanding, like play games, I've got to install the rest of the components.
- is this a fine analogy? idk...
