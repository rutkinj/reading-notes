What makes an API RESTful?

- Lots of stuff but the most important things are crud functionality using http requests, so uniform interface, and statelessness, so all requests are selfcontained/don't need info outside of themselves/already have that info.

What is the benefit of using GraphQL? Any downsides?

- easier for developers???
- if you just need one tiny bit of data, you can get just that tiny bit of data, instead of the whole object that bit of data lives in
- because of this, queries can get complicated

Describe “serverless” to a new 301 Code Fellows student.

- Okay so, the cloud isn't some nebulous data floating in the atmosphere, it's just some computer somwhere else, right? Serverless is the same idea, it's not that there is no server, it's just not a server you need to maintain. You use third party services that live on some server somewhere, maybe even a different server for each service!
