## DRY

- Don't Repeat Yourself
- WET Waste Everyone's Time, Write Everything Twice
- AHA Avoid Hasty Abstractions. I think I've been guilty of this one, starting with abstraction as a baseline has got me into trouble.
- AHA was originally DAMP or MOIST, AHA is better. I'd throw DANK into the ring.

## Rule of Three

- Repeat yourself twice, but three times and you refactor.
- This sounds like an AHA more than a DRY

## YAGNI

- You Aren't Gonna Need It!
- don't add functionality until you need it
- keep it simple, stupid

## MVP

- product with just enough functionality to be meaningfully interacted with and reviewed.
- crazy to me that this strategy works in a real world environment. I would guess that most of feedback would be along the lines of "it looks so ugly" but maybe you choose your testbase carefully?
- Steve Blank: "Youâ€™re selling the vision and delivering the minimum feature set to visionaries, not everyone." There's your answer.
