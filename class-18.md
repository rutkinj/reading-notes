## Many to Many

- Many to Many ex -> employees can be assigned many projects; projects can have many employees assigned to them
- similar implementation as one to many, @ManyToMany annotation
- the tutorial also uses a cascade which im not sure what it is
- cascade is used in conjunction with table join so maybe its a way to iterate through tables?
- there is an owning side and an inverse side; owning side owns table join, inverse side maps from ownings table
