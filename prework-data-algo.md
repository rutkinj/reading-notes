# Data Structures and Algorithms

What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?

- I guess I would say how you're planning to work with the data? Are you gonna work with specific data points or the data as a whole? Is your data going to grow or stay the same size? I guess that's two things. This question is hard to answer because it seems like there are lots of important factors...

How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?

- make sure you have an unavoidable base case?
- also don't forget to make a base case
