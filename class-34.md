How are releases and versioning related?

- Each release should have a unique version. A release is a snapshot of an app and a version is how that snapshot is identified?

What are the 5 main tasks you need to complete to prepare your application for release to the Google Play Store?

1. Configure your app
    - disable logging and debuggability
    - set version info
1. Build and sign(?) release ver
    - sounds like just 'build -> release and sign'
1. Test release ver
1. Update resources
    - ensure images/graphics are stored in app, or properly hosted
1. Prepare remote resources
    - check amplify stuff
