# Engineering Readings

What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?

- I would say customer interfacing experience is a big one. Tailoring very specific solutions for total strangers in the span of ten minutes was something I did a lot, A LOT. And maybe that's something that a lot of people actually have experience in, so then I would say it's my particular approach that would set me apart. My approach being focused on making the interaction enjoyable and relaxed, a definite person to person interaction.

What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?

- Take a break! Walk around, get a snack, have a stretch.
- Reassess the problem, just go over it again carefully and with no assumptions.
- Try to break it down into smaller bits so I have a direction to pivot to for a moment.
- Don't sweat it!
