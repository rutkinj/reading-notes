What makes a RecyclerView dynamic?

- a recycler view holds a certain number of elements (views?) and dynamically populates those elements with dat from a list. If you had a recycler view with 3 elements and a list with 10 elements, the recycler view could display that whole list but only 3 elements at a time, replacing data as recycler view elements scoll out of view.

Share a screenshot of a recycler view in an application you use!

- How about describing something that needs a recycler view... My "smart" tv hbo app, does not recycle items. The farther you scroll, the worse performance gets, until the app literally just completely crashes because the tv runs out of memory while holding all that non-recycled movie data that you are no longer looking at. Dumb.
