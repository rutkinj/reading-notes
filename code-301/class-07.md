Who is Roy Fielding?

Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?

- huge variety of formatting: different programming languages, operating systems, web browsers, etc

What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?

What does a GET do?

- GETs a resource from somewhere else, a picture, a whole page, a bit of information, and brings it back to the page.

What does a POST do?

- adds something to another system

What does PUT do?

- "partial update"??? not sure how thi differes from PUT
